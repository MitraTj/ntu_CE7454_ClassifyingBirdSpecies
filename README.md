# Classification of Birds in Singapore

Singapore is a vibrant tropical country that, in spite of its urbanization, offers a paradise for nature lovers. In particular, its nature reserves are home to a host of different species of birds, attracting birdwatchers, nature enthusiasts and simple weekend hikers from all over the world. The official website of [Singapore's National Parks](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/wildlife-in-singapore/species-list/bird) catalogs over 400 different bird species that can be found on the island. Thus, it happens frequently to take a picture or see a bird flying in the wild and not being able to recognize the species.

The aim of this project is to develop a classification system for bird species that are specific to Singapore. This could be the starting point of an application for photographers and bird enthusiasts.
